# The source folder of C bindings

This folder contains the source files needed for the C bindings to work.
Documentation is in file DOC.md

If you chose to recompile C bindings, feel free to use any compiler supporting at
least C++11 (GCC, Clang, MSVC should be OK), but keep in mind that the same compiler (or
standard library at least) must be used with your C program also because of ABI breaks with C++.
Though it is not a problem with C programs.

Have fun enjoying my library! :)
